= Anno Plan

NOTE: Math assumes 80% productivity for goods, which helps to account for temporary interruptions and shipping delays.

NOTE: Included are increases of construction materials at each tier. This isn't strictly necessary, but it will avoid waiting. Some materials, like sails and weapons, don't really need any increases.

== Workers

NOTE: Workers for shipbuilding are not accounted for, because this is always temporary. I typically toggle steelworks or weapons on/off if a ship is in the works.
