* felt more than heard
* too much: overly powerful
* too little: weak, thin

== 60-250 bass

* how fat/thin the sound is
* fundamental notes of rhythm

* "bass presence"
* boost around 300 can add clarity to bass
* too much: muddy

== 500-2000 midrange

* determines how prominent an instrument is in the mix
* boost around 1000 can give a horn-like quality
* too much: tinny, ear fatigue

== 2000-4000 upper midrange

* human hearing is very sensitive here -- tiny change can result in huge change to timbre
* attack on percussive/rhythm instruments
* boost can add presence
* too much: ear fatigue

== 4000-6000 presence

* clarity/definition
* too much: irritating, harsh sound
* too little: distant, transparent
