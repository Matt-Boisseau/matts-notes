Hey! These are my notes. Browse them on the left.

My goal with this site was to streamline the process of note-taking and publishing. The only step is to commit and push new `.adoc` files to this site's GitHub repository -- by the magic of GitHub Pages, it appears before you. There's no building or command-line or FTP or anything else that might take 30 seconds out of my day.

This is accomplished by way of AsciiDoctorJS, a library that allows me to convert `.adoc` files to HTML code on the fly. As you navigate around this site, a simple script reads the URL, finds the corresponding `.adoc` file, converts it to HTML, and slaps it in this section here.
