Hey! These are my notes. Unless you're me, there probably isn't too much to find here.

My goal in creating this site was to streamline the process of note-taking and publishing. To that end, there's no building or deploying necessary; just writing and pushing to master. That's as lightweight as it gets, at least from a workflow perspective--I'm not too fussed about performance in this context.

Because I don't need to differentiate between updating the repo and updating this site, I know that my notes will always be easy to pull up. And it's certainly preferable to share a link to my personal site than to a GitHub repository (not even getting into the way `.adoc` includes don't even work in the GitHub previewer).

Here's how it works, if you're curious or wanting to set up something similar:

* GitHub Pages publishes the site every time I `git push`.
* `Window.history` looks for `.adoc` files based on the URL.
* AsciiDoctorJS converts `.adoc` content to HTML on the fly.
