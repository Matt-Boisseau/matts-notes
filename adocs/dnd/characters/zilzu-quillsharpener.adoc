.dope magic items to maybe create
* mystery key (1-in-20 to unlock a door, disappears on success)
* perfume of bewitching (apply to self for advantage on CHA checks on challenge-1 humanoids, 1 charge)
* pole of collapsing (1ft rod that changes to 10ft on a command word)
* rope of climbing (60ft rope that moves on its own, knots, etc)
* sending stones (come in pairs, touching one lets you cast "sending" to the other stone)
* walloping ammunition (creature hit by this must succeed on DC 10 STR save or be knocked prone)
