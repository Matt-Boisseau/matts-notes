= Dragons' Squall

"
Your adventuring party is sailing out on the calm sea--no shores in sight--when the sunny sky begins to fill with dark clouds. Within minutes, the waves grow violent and throw your ship into something unseen beneath the surface.

== Notes

* dragons fighting over rights to Trench Treasure

* attack rolls underwater have disadvantage unless they are from dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, trident, crossbow, net, dart
** ranged weapons can only use close-range number
* soaked creatures have resistance to fire damage
* move same distance underwater as on land
