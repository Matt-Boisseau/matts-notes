= Session Ideas

== Brief (what you know before accepting the mission)

An old asteroid mine has come online after decades of abandonment. The corporation that still legally owns the site wants to reclaim the facility. The asteroid's current residents don't have much chance of maintaining autonomy, but they aren't going to go quietly.

== Situation (what you learn upon arrival)



== Details (what you CAN learn, but might miss)

Residents' leader wants to use mined resource to create a super weapon!

== Dilemma (potential consequences of your interference)

* Side with residents, allow them to become a military power.
* Side with corporation, dislocate residents.
* Reason with corporation to let residents stay, albeit under their control.
* Remove evil resident leader, then force corporation to leave residents in peace.
* Tell corporation about the potential weapon, causing them to double down on commandeering the facility.
