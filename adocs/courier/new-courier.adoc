= New Courier?

== B

* players control ancient relics that strive for balance
** prevent anyone from gaining too much power
** keep ecosystems (flora/fauna) in relatively equal distribution
** commune with the land itself to prevent natural disasters
* every game, each player is held by one of 22 major arcana characters
** these characters are mostly blank slates at the start
** teach and guide your character as you play
** maintain friendship with your character so they continue to cooperate
** characters have some kind of lineage with their card, so you can have permanent influence/benefit
* make your mark on the permanent world by visiting every 10-100 years
** move a character into or out of a position of power
*** build infrastructure like roads
*** start or end conflicts
** change environment by causing or averting dramatic changes
* agents of chaos (or something like that) exist to make balance increasingly difficult
** if the island falls out of equilibrium... what happens?
*** you lose the island forever?
*** some progress is undone?
*** your relics are replaced?
* setting is kind of ambiguous
** modern or even futuristic tech
** overlapping ruins of many lost civilizations (from times other players lost)

== A

* static cast of 22 major arcana characters
** controlled by players when fated
** characters grow across games
** card can give basic info like name, job, etc
*** they probably become pretty complicated, which is okay
* modern/futuristic urban setting
** light fantasy (animism)
** Persona vibes?
** omniboi lush dream vibes?
** vaporwave?
* everything closer
** hours instead of days
** hangin' out instead of camping
* relic types
** devices (wands)
** adornments (cups)
** weapons (swords)
** tools (pentacles)

some sort of ancient conflict? relics are varying levels of ancient?

metaphorical kingdom? keep barons concept, etc

could be literal baronies or city-states, just in modern cities?

what kind of conflict is between the barons? what are they trying to control or rule over?

maybe not fully urban, but more focused on the spaces between? (death stranding)

characters are likely explorers/archaeologists/historians who are in-the-know on the relics and actively seeking them

or do the relics _call out_ to the characters? the relics want to achieve some sort of cosmic balance

spirit of courier has always been wilderness... perhaps unexplored land is best? but then what are they barons of?

young/contested land probably makes the most sense, or even ruined land?
