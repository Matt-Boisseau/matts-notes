# Earth Timeline

## Hadean

Earth formed from protoplanetary disk. No life. Extremely hot. Frequent volcanic activity.

| Mya
| event

| 4600
| Earth forms from accretion disc (organic compounds already there)

| 4500
| Theia impact sends moonlets into orbit (these eventually form Luna)

| 4400
| liquid water forms

|===

## Archaean

Abiogenesis (origin of life from non-living matter). Early supercontinents.

[cols="1,10"]
|===

| 4000
| first greenstone belt forms (oldest rock, ore deposits)

| 4000
| late heavy bombardment (meteoroid impacts -> thermal activity -> abiogenesis == life)

| 3800
| bacteria evolve

| 3500
| LUCA (split between bacteria and archaea)

| 3500
| bacteria develop primitive photosynthesis

| 3000
| cyanobacteria evolve (photosynthesizing bacteria that use water and output O2) -> Great Oxidation Event -> iron ore formation (oceans rust), extinction of non-cyanobacteria (O2 == poision), global cooling (greenhouse gas)

|===

## Proterozoic

Eukaryotes (more complex life). Oxygen from photosynthetic Cyanobacteria. Early fungi, plants, and animal. More early supercontinents.

[cols="1,10"]
|===

| 2500
| plate tectonics begin (marine crust is dense enough to subduct)

| 1800
| eukaryotes evolve

| 1300
| fungi evolve

| 1200
| meiosis (sexual reproduction) evolves (and probably increases the rate of evolution)

| 1000
| non-marine eukaryotes (plants?) evolve

| 750
| animals evolve (first protozoa)

| 650
| Snowball Earth (maybe)

| 600
| ozone layer forms (due to atmospheric oxygen created by photosynthesizers)

|===

## Phanerozoic

Complex life, including vertebrates. Cambrian Explosion. Pangea and modern continents. Lots of evolution. Humans.

### Paleozoic

Dramatic geological, climactic, evolution change. Appearance of most modern phyla. Transition to life on land. Forests of primitive plants.

[cols="1,10"]
|===

| 550
| Cambrian Explosion (most major animal phyla appear, all organisms diversify -- before this, most organisms were colonies of single-celled organisms)

| 485
| first vertebrates with bones (jawless fish)

| 410
| first teeth (in fish)

| 395
| first tetrapods (4-legged, spined animals)

| 365
| acanthostega (one of the first vertebrates capable of walking)

| 363
| Carboniferous Period begins (Earth begins to resemble modern Earth -- insects and vegetation covering land, sharks as top predators in oceans, tetrapods adapt to terrestrial life)

| 360
| land dominated by seed ferns

| 330
| first amniote vertebrates (lay eggs on land or retain eggs within mother -- reptiles, birds, mammals) aka "higher vertebrates"

| 320
| synapsids (precursors to mammals) separate from sauropsids (reptiles)

| 250
| Permian-Triassic extinction (eliminates 90+% of marine species -- "clean slate")

|===

### Mesozoic

Age of Reptiles / Age of Conifers. Dinosaurs. Mammals. Pangaea.

[cols="1,10"]
|===

| 250
| Mesozoic Marine Revolution (increasingly diverse predators pressure sessile marine groups)

| 225
| first dinosaurs and first mammals

| 220
| gymnosperm forests dominate land -> herbivores grow to huge sizes to accommodate the large guts necessary to digest nutrient-poor plants

| 205
| Triassic/Jurassic extinction

| 190
| extensive development of sponge reefs

| 130
| rise of angiosperms that either attract animals to spread pollen -> evolutionary burst due to coevolution

| 90
| large diversification in angiosperms

|===

### Cenozoic

Begins with asteroid impact (dinosaur extinction). Age of Mammals. Modern times.

[cols="1,10"]
|===

| 66
| Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (eliminates about half of all animal species, including all dinosaurs -- this allows mammals to dominate)

| 66
| rapid dominance of conifers and ginkgoes, mammals becoming dominant species

| 60
| first primates

| 55
| modern bird groups diversify

| 35
| grasses diversify from angiosperms, many modern mammal groups appear

| 10
| grasslands and savannahs are established, diversity in insects, diversity in grassland mammals

| 2
| first members of Homo (Homo Habilis), and ancestor of cattle

| 0.35
| neanderthals

| 0.25
| anatomically modern humans

| 0.03
| extinction of neanderthals, first domestic dogs
