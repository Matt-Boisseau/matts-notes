## Phonology

### Consonants

|                 | bi-labial | post-alveolar | velar |
| --------------: | :-------- | :------------ | :---- |
|     **plosive** | p         | d             | k     |
|       **nasal** |           | n             |       |
|         **tap** |           | r /ɾ/         |       |
|   **fricative** | f /ɸ/     | z /ʒ/         |       |
| **approximant** |           |               | j     |

### Vowels

|           | front | central         | back |
| --------: | :---- | :-------------- | :--- |
| **close** | i     |                 |      |
|   **mid** |       |                 | o    |
|  **open** |       | a /ʋa/ (a /a/)¹ |      |

¹ *`a` is pronounced `/a/` only when following `n`, `r`, and `j` in the syllable. Otherwise, it is pronounced `/ʋa/`.*

## Phonotactics

Adjacent phonemes only combine if one is a consonant and the other is a vowel. No more than two phonemes form any one syllable.

`pidoa` forms three syllables: `/pi.do.ʋa/`. `pioa` also forms three syllables, because two vowels cannot exist within one syllable: `/pi.o.ʋa/`.

In other terms, each syllable takes one of three forms: V, CV, or VC.

In phonological terms:

- a nucleus is always comprised of a single phoneme
- a nucleus never has both an onset and a coda
- no two consonants form a valid onset cluster

Ambiguous sequences--such as `ikona` (either `/i.ko.na/` or `/ik.on.ʋa/`)--preserve the structure of their root words. Homonyms are possible:  
`i` + `kona` = `/i.ko.na/`  
`ikon` + `a` = `/ik.on.ʋa/`

The first syllable of each word is stressed. Subsequent odd-numbered syllables are lightly stressed.  
`pidoai`  
`/ˈˈpi.do.ˈʋa.i/`

## Morphology

### Inflectional Affixes

|    inflection | meaning                        | independent   |
| ------------: | :----------------------------- | :------------ |
| (omitted `i`) | singular or contextual         |               |
|           `i` | complete, full                 | fulfillment   |
|          `io` | overflowing, excessive         |               |
|          `ia` | empty, lacking                 |               |
| (omitted `o`) | as defined or contextual       | something     |
|           `o` | essential quality (-ly/-esque) | essence       |
|          `oi` | inhabitant                     | someone       |
|          `oa` | place                          | somewhere     |
| (omitted `a`) | independent or contextual      |               |
|           `a` | abstract or in general         | theory, story |
|          `ai` | relative to the speaker        |               |
|          `ao` | relative to the addressee      |               |

Each of the above inflectional affixes can be used as a suffix or independently, in which case the inflection takes its most general meaning and functions according to its syntactic location.

### Meta

Sentences contain front-loaded meta-information that indicates tense, modality, agency, and evidentiality.

## Syntax

Words do not belong to specific parts of speech. Instead, every word can function as any part of speech depending on its position in a sentence. As such, word order carries a lot of syntactical weight. The order is as follows:  
`(meta) [noun (actor)] [noun (patient)] [verbs/adjectives]`

Simplified example using literal translation:

	self  workplace foot
	actor patient   verb
	lit. "Me at work via feet."
	"I walk to work."

A simple sentence requires only an actor and patient. The inferred verb is something like "has" or "is." It is enough to simply establish the relationship between the actor and patient:

	cat   beauty
	actor patient
	lit. "Cat is related to beauty."
	"That's a beautiful cat."
