= Untitled Werewolf One-Shot

== Prompt

The duke has sent a total of three tax collectors to the remote village of Bithell. None have come back. Get down there, collect the amount they owe, and apprehend whoever is killing tax collectors.

== Idea

. full moon
. see and half-fight wolf outside of town
. talk to village druid, who is healing those injured by werewolf attacks
** "as you can see, this village is in no state to pay... but, if you solve our werewolf problem, everything can go back to normal"
. adventure through forest->cave->werewolf-den
. werewolf is hiding... he is hurt from the previous fight
** "please leave before I hurt you... I used to be able to control it, but, apparently, I've been killing people... the druid gave me potions to try to help, but I guess they didn't work"
** investigation of potions reveals that they are sleeping potions... what's going on here?
** party can choose whether or not to slay the werewolf
. if party wants pay or tries to ask about the werewolf, the druid reveals that he is behind the killings
** he uses shape-change to transform into a wolf, puts the real werewolf to sleep, and blames the killings on him
** he does this to steal outsiders' gold while pretending to be a poor, downtrodden village that can't pay taxes
** after revealing his evil plan, he shape-changes and attacks
*** "and now, I'll do the same to you!"
