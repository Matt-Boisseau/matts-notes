= Designing One-Shots (Designing Short Dungeons)

* hit all the "pillars"
	** exploration
		*** branching paths
		*** hidden or difficult shortcuts
		*** hidden or difficult loot
	** combat
		*** fewer, more interesting enemies
		*** varied terrain and room shapes
		*** PC goals other than "kill all enemies"
	** roleplay
		*** NPCs who respond directly to PC actions
		*** diplomatic ways to circumvent some combat
		*** hard choices
* encourage PCs to pursue optional rewards
	** place secrets everywhere (they won't get them all)
	** allow PCs to "cash in" partway through (shop or other exchange)
	** make optional rewards more interesting than the way forward

## Encounter Goals

Impedance:: get past room OR get in and out with object
* slow, semi-passive monsters (ooze, animated shrub, etc)
* strong, neutral enemies that easily aggro (sleeping, watching, etc)
* infinitely spawning or keep getting back up

Ambush:: survive or avoid
* humanoids or other "smart" enemies, hiding
* monsters released as a trap
* can thwart by checking carefully

Regicide:: take out leader
* summon trash mobs every turn
* power up for a big move in ~3 turns
* numerous or strong enemies lose efficacy or retreat when leader is defeated

Defend:: keep enemies at bay
* protect an NPC or object for ~3 turns
* survive for ~3 turns
* use action to either fight or work towards a shared task that ends the combat

Chase:: move faster than enemies
* get to the device/treasure/exit before the enemy
* chase an enemy who ran off with something you need
* fight while staying in a moving safe-zone

Hunt:: kill what you came to kill
* ramp up enemy abilities to keep combat short and satisfying
* environment in enemy's favor
* clues in previous rooms to give away weaknesses, damage types, etc
