= Spaceship Guys (Working Title)

Adversarial GM-vs-players TTRPG.

GM takes the role of a rogue agent posing as HQ:

* keep up your VERISIMILITUDE by helping the crew
* further your EVIL PLOT by delaying the crew's mission as long as possible
* try not to accidentally kill the whole crew

Players take the roles of crew members:

* keep the ship in one piece
* keep yourself in one piece
* complete the mission as quickly as possible

Play alternates between HQ actions (either helping or hindering the crew) and crew actions (keeping things together or furthering the mission).
