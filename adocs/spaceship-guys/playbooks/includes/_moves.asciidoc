= Moves

Moves are actions that your character can take. Each move has a Trigger ("When..."), an associated Stat, and a list of Edges and Hitches to choose from. Whenever something done by your character triggers a Move, roll 2d6+Stat.

CAUTION: Triggering moves is *not optional*. Keep an eye out for your character's triggers, as well as those of other players.
