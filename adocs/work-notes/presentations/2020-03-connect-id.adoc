== Outline

//? which slides are the most important
// why > what

. brief personal intro

. why should I care? -> modern identity is more than one problem
* has become more complicated over time
* point out some of the things on this slide
//? which of these are the most important things to point out
* "it's no longer just a login page"

. you need identity, but it doesn't earn revenue
* you could roll your own, _but_
** it takes time (and time==money)
** you're not security experts
* you cold buy it from the other guys, _but_
** FA edge
*** feature rich w/out insane price tag
*** downloadable
*** platform vs just-a-feature (can build your app on top of FA, "FA app")
* FusionAuth is ready now, so you don't have to spend time reinventing the wheel

. FusionAuth is a modern identity solution
* not built on outdated, confusing tech
* FusionAuth is built to make sense for today's technology
** it's easy to understand and organized in a way that makes sense
** old, hard to learn private language/jargon vs just plain English

. everything you need in an identity platform
//? which of these are the most important things to point out

. all the bases covered
//? single vs multi tenant in FA context... we say "always single-tenant" here and "single-tenant" on slide 9
//? think about confusing tenant language
* host yourself or leave it to us
* use any platform
* manage as few or as many users as you need
* easy third-party integration

. some other FusionAuth benefits
* cut down on dev time
* get more downloads thanks to built-in localization
//? how does FA facilitate business workflows across multiple backends--webhooks etc
//? is account merging a unique feature or are we just talking about db cloning
* enterprise-grade security on prototype timelines
* keep users across all of your apps

. FusionAuth is built for Developers
* so fast to install, you could have it running before this talk is over
** go to fusionauth.io/download and try it
** runs on anything

. "Enterprise-Grade Security"
//? how does tenancy affect security?
//? which of these are the most important things to point out

. "Stability & Scalability"
* almost 100% uptime
//? why do we say 150M -- is that just the amount we've tested
//? what is DataStax and why do people care about it--DS as client of FA

. and it's not just auth--it's full user management
* easy to manage and inspect users
** they can be registered to any number of your apps running from the same FusionAuth

. theme the FusionAuth login page so users never feel like they've left your app
* notice automatic localization

. every growing app needs reports--we put it on your dashboard from day one
//? what does the reporting actually look like in FusionAuth -- would it be better to have a screenshot of the real thing

. get everything you need in an identity platform
//? which features are the BIG CALLOUTS
//? CTA--try free now
//? probably no time for Qs--give contact info to talk later if people want

. quick demo?
//? what would be included in a 1-2m demo
* demos from demo.fusionauth.io/admin/system/demo-setup
** put in their app name
** 4 top level concepts
*** 4 things down the side menu
*** logical isolations
** search users
*** show preferred languages
*** show registrations (can show giving access to admin panel)
*** show action user (there are dummy actions in there)
**** this sends a message to your backend
**** check user's action history
*** show custom data (per app)
** show consents (there are some already in there)
** show family modeling w/ griswolds (COPPA allows parents to grant kids permissions)
** show reports
*** data also available via API
